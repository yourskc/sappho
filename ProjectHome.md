### Abstract ###
_sappho_ is a web photo album that hosts the image files on [Amazon Web Services'](http://aws.amazon.com/) [Simple Storage Service](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). We use [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) for storing additional information about the images and [PHP](http://www.php.net/) for generating dynamic pages.



### Status ###
